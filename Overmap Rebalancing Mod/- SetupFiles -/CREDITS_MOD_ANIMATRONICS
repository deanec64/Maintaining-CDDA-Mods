    CONTENT - LET'S HEAR THE AUTHOR:

    Just in time for FNaF 3 coming out, an update to incorporate a lot of FNaF 2 things. I'm sorry, I'm not as
    dedicated as Scott Cawthon xD
    This mod adds a building called a bankrupt pizzeria to the game. These buildings spawn animatronic robots inside.
    They're big, they're fast, and have fallen into disrepair since the apocalypse hit...
    Wait, if they are robots, why do they stink like death?

    Please report bugs, I added a lot and haven't had a chance to test it all myself.
