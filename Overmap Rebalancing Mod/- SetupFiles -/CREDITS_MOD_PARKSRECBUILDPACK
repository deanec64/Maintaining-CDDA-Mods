    Thank you for your fantastic work! :)

    CONTENT - LET'S HEAR THE AUTHOR:

    Parks and Recreation Building Pack - Take a Joint(lit) and enjoy a stroll in the park
    Cemetary - Self Explanitory / Orchard - Fruit trees and a small shelter / Wooded Trail - Small fenced in trails /
    Hunting Blind - A small shelter, probably good for hunting deer zombies / Skatepark - Self Explanitory / Art
    Gallery - Pretty useless, purely for aesthetics / Park Pavilion - A small pavilion with picnic benches / Derelict
    Property - Think of those broken down barns/properties you see off the highways or on country roads.
    2x2 Buildings: State Park - Bigger looping trail / Fishing Pond - Large pond
    Bonus: Dispensary - Cannabis dispensary / Small Office - Nondescript office with a small kitchen, meeting room, etc.
    Small Storage Units - A small group of storage units. (I had a similar storage unit building type in my last
    building pack, so if you want to use that you may get larger 2x2 storage lots, thus this building is called "Small
    Storage Units.")
    Hope you enjoy, feel free to tell me things you think I should change or add, or just yell at me.
    Thanks to Vache for the Cataclysm Building Editor.
